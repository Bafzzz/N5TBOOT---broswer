#OTHER-INFO
now also some stuff may not load becuase its light-weight if you are looking for some stuff that wont load than go to the TESTS which should be under this text. Also like said in the top no info is seen by me or anyone all info is hidden so no worrys about anyone finding about what you are looking up nothing gets sent to anything like webhooks, loggers or anything NOW I WILL WARN YOU your search history does get del right after but on your bill and router it may still be visble! so be careful
