#  OTHER-INFO
Due to its lightweight nature, some websites may not load properly. If you encounter this, check the TESTS section below for a list of websites that may not function correctly.

As mentioned earlier, N5TBOOT does not collect or track your data. Your search history remains private and is cleared immediately after use. No information is sent to third parties—no webhooks, no loggers, nothing. However, please note that while your search history is deleted, it may still be visible on your billing or router logs, so exercise caution.
